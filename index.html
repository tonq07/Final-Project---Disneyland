        <p>
            With the stressors of school and work, my family and I make it a priority to ensure that we take some time off.
            We are all huge on Disney and Pixar that we plan a trip to Disneyland each year. For some, it may be stressful to
            deal with all the logistics that are associated with planning and executing a trip. But for us, it is all pays off
            once we reach our destination of the Disneyland gates. Just seeing the joy that our kids are having and knowing that 
            these are lifetime memories for them make it all worth it!
        </p>
        <p>
            From thrilling rides to delicious snacks and glowing nighttime parades, each trip to <strong>Disneyland</strong> is definitely one for the books!
